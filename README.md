# Decent

*Decent* is an endless runner built in Unity as part of a university project.  
The game takes players on a journey through the layers of hell, with escalating difficulty and unique bosses at the end of each level.  

## Gameplay
You play as a runner descending deeper and deeper through hell.  
- **Run, dodge, and fight** your way through endless levels  
- Each layer of hell introduces new challenges, starting with **Limbo** and **Lust**  
- Face a **unique boss** at the end of every level  
- Collect **power-ups** such as:  
  - Speed boosts  
  - Score multipliers  
  - Temporary invincibility  
- Push your limits to survive as the difficulty ramps up  

## Development Notes
This project was created as part of a **university coursework project**, and was my **first Unity game**.  

Key focuses included:  
- **Core Systems** â€“ player controller, endless runner logic, and overall game loop  
- **Boss Battles** â€“ scripted encounters with unique mechanics at the end of each level  
- **Power-Ups** â€“ speed, score, and invincibility systems implemented in code  
- **Animation Systems** â€“ animation scripts for smooth character behaviour  
- **Event-Driven Architecture** â€“ decoupled systems using events for maintainable code  
- **Online Features** â€“ Firebase leaderboard integration (currently disabled due to service expiry, but can be re-enabled)
